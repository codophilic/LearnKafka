# About Apache Kafka
- Apache Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform. Designed as an open-source system by the Apache Software Foundation, it is written in Java and Scala.
- Apache Kafka is like a communication system that helps different parts of a computer system to exchange data by publishing and subscribing to a particular topic.
- In Kafka , there is a sender or a producer which published the data into Kafka and the receiver or consumer can consume the data by subscribing the topic for which they required data in Kafka.

- Imagine you have a social media platform where users post updates, and you want these updates to appear in the feeds of all their friends in real-time. When a user posts an update, the social media platform sends this update to Kafka, which acts like a central hub. Kafka then stores the update in a specific category called a topic, let's say user-updates. Friends of the user have systems that check this user-updates topic in Kafka. As soon as the update is stored, these systems read the new update from Kafka and immediately show it in the friends' activity feeds. This way, all friends see the user's update in real-time. Kafka ensures that the updates are delivered reliably and can handle a large number of updates simultaneously, keeping the social media experience smooth and instant for all users.
- Example
  - LinkedIn: Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn to handle large-scale data streams efficiently.
  - Twitter : Handling high-volume real-time data, such as tweets, retweets, and likes
  - Netflix : Kafka helps Netflix process and analyze billions of events per day, ensuring a seamless streaming experience.
  - Uber : Kafka helps Uber manage high volumes of real-time data to optimize rides and provide accurate pricing.
- Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. It has a full queue that can accept large amounts of message data. With Kafka, applications can write and read data on topics. A topic presents a category for labeling data. Furthermore, the application can receive messages from one or more categories.
- Apache Kafka can be thought of as a robust and scalable messaging system that allows the seamless transfer of data streams between different applications or systems. It serves as a highly efficient intermediary platform, enabling real-time data processing, analysis, and integration across diverse components.
